# NLP_Gold_Silver_Sentiments
Task: Write two short NLP pipelines in Python. The first one should identify tokens that refer to gold and silver (with separate identifiers for each) as financial commodities. Print out the number of documents in the sample file containing at least one reference to gold and the same for silver. The second pipeline should compute the sentiment of sentences where gold or silver are mentioned as commodities. Print out one overall (full sample file) sentiment value for gold and for silver separately.
